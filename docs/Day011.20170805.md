Have to build a responsive framework.

target: responsive toolbar, sidenav, content, footer

Responsive(and any other main layout) solution: create a framework component, defines header bar, sidenav, content..etc as slots, and then use it in app.vue, put what needed into slots.

with named router, we can render different components on the same route..
