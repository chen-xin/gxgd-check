mutation and actions:

I can still do async operations in mutations..

configured proxy table as :
```
proxyTable: {'/rest': {target: 'http://localhost:3000', pathRewrite: {'^/rest': ''}}}
```

TODO:
1. Eletron
2. combine backend and frontend dev run script
3. treeview with no root
4. router

Tried adding router to tree.
IView seems good.
